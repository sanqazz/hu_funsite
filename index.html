    <h1>Discography</h1>
  <div>
      <p>Hollywood Undead hail from the streets of Hollywood, California, mixing brash hip-hop, rock,
      and minor metalcore touches with cocky posturing. With their colorful pseudonyms and unique hockey goal tender-inspired masks,
      the band debuted in 2008 with <a href="#swang_song_article">Swan Songs</a>, but didn't hit their commercial stride until the release of their 2011 sophomore
        effort, <a href="#american_tragedy_article">American Tragedy</a>, which cracked the Top Ten on the Billboard 200 chart. Subsequent outings like <a href="#notes_from_the_underground_article">Notes from
        the Underground</a> (2013) and <a href="#day_of_the_dead_article">Day of the Dead</a> (2015) performed just as well, if not better, cementing the group's reputation
          as one of rapcore's leading lights. Hollywood Undead's fifth record is titled <a href="#five_article">Five</a> (or V),
           and was released on October 27, 2017. The first single from the album, called "California Dreaming", was made available July 24,
            2017. At the moment, the latest album <a href="#new_empire_article">New Empire</a> vol.1 was released on February 14, 2020. </p>

<!-- Biography -->
<div class="biography" id="biography">
  <h1>Biography</h1>
<div>
  <p>The band consists of <a href="#charlie_scene_title">Charlie Scene</a>, <a href="#danny_title">Danny</a>, <a href="#funny_man_title">Funny Man</a>, <a href="#j_dog_title">J-Dog</a>,
    and <a href="#johnny_3_tears_title">Johnny 3 Tears</a>. The band members use pseudonyms and wear masks to display a creative side, not to hide their identities as first
     assumed. They perform live without the masks on.</p>
   <br>
 <p>The band originated in 2005 from a song titled "The Kids" that Aron Erlichman (Deuce) and Jorel Decker (J-Dog) posted on the band's
    MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends "Shady" Jeff Philips,
     George Ragan (Johnny 3 Tears), Jordon Terrell (Charlie Scene), Dylan Alvarez (Funny Man), and Matthew St. Claire (Da Kurlzz).
      In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band "Whoever was in the room at the time and played 
      an instrument was in the band."</p>
  
  <br>
  <div id = 'biography_article'>
    <div>
      <div class = 'photo_left'><img src="./img/biography/charlie_scene.jpg" alt="charlie scene photo"></div>
      <div class = 'biography_article_right'><h4 id = 'charlie_scene_title'>Charlie Scene</h4>Jordon Terrell was born in Burbank,
         California on September 3, 1985. He knew future bandmate Funny Man from a young age, and they hung out very regularly growing up.
          Charlie is featured in almost every song from the band and usually raps about partying, girls, drugs, drinks and kicking ass,
           although he has also written verses about emotional, strong thoughts. He is classified as the "gangster" of the band.
            He appeared at the Family Values festival, which also featured Jonathan Davis and his band Korn. </div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <div class = 'biography_article_left'><h4 id = 'danny_title'>Danny</h4>Daniel Murillo is one of the current vocalists
         for Hollywood Undead, replacing Deuce since early 2010. He began to tour with them prior to his official introduction to the band
          in mid-2008, filling in for Deuce while he was absent.

      <div class = 'biography_article_right'><h4 id = 'funny_man_title'>Funny Man</h4> Dylan Peter Alvarez is a big live favorite of the band due to
         his lively performances and crowd hyping. He has been known to jump into the crowd, often be shirtless and occasionally not wear
          pants. Although he isn't as frequently featured on songs that much like Charlie, J-Dog or Johnny his songs are about partying,
           drinking, women, and having a good time. He very rarely appears on serious tracks.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <div class = 'biography_article_left'><h4 id = 'j_dog_title'>J-Dog</h4><p>Jorel Decker was born in Los Angeles,
         California on May 1, 1984. His mother was, as J-Dog describes "a hippie" and his father was a truck driver, and insisted on
          Jorel becoming a truck driver later on in life as well. He first met future bandmate Johnny 3 Tears when he was very young,
           but they did not like each other when they first met.He grew up with Deuce and hung out regularly with Charlie Scene's older
            brother, Jake Terrell.</p>
          <p>His first musical interest was when his mom took him to see the British band "The Who" live when he was 13, and it motivated him
            to start making music, and the bass player of the band specifically made him have a particular interest in playing bass.</p>

      <div class = 'biography_article_right'><h4 id = 'johnny_3_tears_title'>Johnny 3 Tears</h4><p>George Arthur Ragan was born in Los Angeles,
         California on June 24, 1981. He first met future band mate J-Dog when he was very young, but they didn't like each other when they
          first met. However, years later, they ended up in the same band.</p>
        <p>He used to date a girl named Carly, along with a few others before meeting a woman named Asia. They have a daughter together,
           named Ava Ragan and are married since January 19, 2018. Asia recently announced on her Instagram that they are going to have
            another baby in November.</p>
        <p>He lived in California almost all his life, most recently in Huntington Beach, before ultimately moving to Nashville,
             Tennessee with his family.</p>
